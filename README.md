- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tooloof
- 👀 I’m interested in technical nerd stuff mostly in winter. In summer I go out fishing instead. And maybe some RC-drone flying.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to figure out how to transfer data from a set of air quality sensors connected by I2C to an ESP32,
which in turn should send data by WiFi to a local interface,
which in  turn should write the data onto an SQL-server running on my NAS...
All of these steps are totally unknown to me, I don't even know how to code anything, so I have lots to learn. 
I don't know where to start. Maybe should go watch Netflix instead?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well, not yet, I can't really contribute.
- 📫 How to reach me ... frni_se@yahoo.se
